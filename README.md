# MovieRecommender

This project demonstrates the creation of a Movie Recommender System using Python and machine learning techniques. The system provides personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and historical data. The notebook was developed using Google Colab and utilizes a dataset sourced from Kaggle.

## Key Features
1. **User-Based Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends movies based on similarities between users.
2. **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:** Suggests movies based on similarities between movies.
3.**Content-Based Filtering:** Utilizes movie metadata to provide recommendations.

## Dataset
The project uses a public movie dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes information on movies, user ratings, and additional metadata that forms the backbone of the recommendation system. Make sure to download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory for the notebook to access.

## Results
1. Personalized movie recommendations tailored to user preferences.
2. Evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and RMSE for assessing model performance.

## Challenges and Learnings
1. **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
2. **Model Selection:** Experimented with various algorithms for collaborative and content-based filtering.
3. **Optimization:** Tuned hyperparameters to improve recommendation accuracy and efficiency.
